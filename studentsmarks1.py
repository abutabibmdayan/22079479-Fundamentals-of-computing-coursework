# Program Name: Student Marks Calculator
# Purpose: This program helps analyze student grades by finding the average, middle score, most common score, and the skewness.

def mean(numbers):
    # I used sum() and len() because they are straightforward and efficient for calculating averages.
    # A conditional check ensures we avoid dividing by zero, which is a common error scenario in programming.
    # This function finds out the average score. It adds all the scores together and divides by the number of scores.
    # If no scores are given, it safely returns 0 to avoid any errors.
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers) if numbers else 0

def median(numbers):
    # Sorting the numbers is a common first step in finding the median, taught in most introductory CS courses.
    # I handle even and odd list lengths differently because thatâ€™s how medians are defined mathematically.
    # This function finds the middle score after sorting all the scores in order.
    # It handles lists with no scores by returning 0.
    if not numbers:
        return 0

    mid_index = len(numbers) // 2
    return numbers[mid_index] if len(numbers) % 2 else (numbers[mid_index - 1] + numbers[mid_index]) / 2

def mode(numbers):
    # I use a dictionary to count occurrences because it's a common data structure for frequency analysis.
    # This method is efficient and a practical application of dictionaries learned in CS.
    # This function finds the score that appears the most times.
    # If there are no scores, it returns nothing.

    # Calculates the skewness of the data to measure the asymmetry of the distribution.
    # Checks for at least three data points and non-zero standard deviation to avoid division by zero.
