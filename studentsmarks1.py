def mean(numbers):
    # I used sum() and len() because they are straightforward and efficient for calculating averages.
    # A conditional check ensures we avoid dividing by zero, which is a common error scenario in programming.
    # This function finds out the average score. It adds all the scores together and divides by the number of scores.
    # If no scores are given, it safely returns 0 to avoid any errors.
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers) if numbers else 0 # Finds the average value of a list of numbers. It adds all the numbers sum(numbers) together and divides by how many numbers len(numbers) there are. If the list has no numbers, it just returns 0.



def median(numbers):
    # Sorting the numbers is a common first step in finding the median, taught in most introductory CS courses.
    # I handle even and odd list lengths differently because thatâ€™s how medians are defined mathematically.
    # This function finds the middle score after sorting all the scores in order.
    # It handles lists with no scores by returning 0.
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    numbers.sort() #sorts the list of numbers in ascending order.
    mid_index = len(numbers) // 2 # Finds the middle index of the list.
    return numbers[mid_index] if len(numbers) % 2 else (numbers[mid_index - 1] + numbers[mid_index]) / 2 # If the list has an even number of elements, it returns the average of the two middle elements. If the list has odd number of elements, it returns the middle element.

def mode(numbers):
    # I use a dictionary to count occurrences because it's a common data structure for frequency analysis.
    # This method is efficient and a practical application of dictionaries learned in CS.
    # This function finds the score that appears the most times.
    # If there are no scores, it returns nothing.
    if not numbers:
        return None
    frequency = {} # Creates an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each number.
    for num in numbers: # Iterates through each number in the list.
        frequency[num] = frequency.get(num, 0) + 1 # Increments the frequency count for each number.
    max_frequency = max(frequency.values(), default=0) # Finds the maximum frequency count.
    return [num for num, count in frequency.items() if count == max_frequency] # Returns a list of numbers with the maximum frequency.

def calculate_skewness(data):
    # Calculates the skewness of the data to measure the asymmetry of the distribution.
    # Checks for at least three data points and non-zero standard deviation to avoid division by zero.
    if len(data) < 3: # Checks if there are at least three data points.
        return None
    mean_val = sum(data) / len(data) # Calculates the mean of the data.
    m3 = sum((x - mean_val) ** 3 for x in data) / len(data)    # Calculates the sum of squared deviations from the mean.
    m2 = sum((x - mean_val) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data) # Calculates the sum of squared deviations from the mean.
    if m2 == 0: # Checks if the standard deviation is zero.
        return None
    skewness = m3 / (m2 ** 1.5) # Calculates the skewness.
